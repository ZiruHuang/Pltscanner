Description: Pltscanner is a machine learning-based R package designed for automated annotation of platelets/megakaryocytes
    in scRNA-seq data. This package offers a fast and accurate prediction method that does not require clustering or
    dimensionality reduction steps and directly predicts the cell type of individual cells. Pltscanner accepts
    Seurat objects as input data and returns a Seurat object with platelet cell labels and prediction scores for each cell.
